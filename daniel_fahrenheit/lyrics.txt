When Daniel Fahrenheit
Wrote the book of life
He set the world on fire
To see how hot it'd burn
From Amsterdam to London
Where else can you learn
How cold is this night
Asks Daniel Fahrenheit

Poison hath begotten
But mushrooms shall not stop him
Four long years he waited
A son without a home
The apprenticeship short lived
Finally began to roam
Shopkeeping was just trite
For Daniel Fahrenheit

Each drop squeezed from sand
The glass he blew by hand
Hatters cool device
Trapped inside his pipe
Try to make it colder
Until it was just right
In mouth but don't bite
Calibrate Daniel Fahrenheit
