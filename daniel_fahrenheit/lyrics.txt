When Daniel Fahrenheit
Wrote the book of life

He set the world on fire
To see how hot it'd burn
From Amsterdam to London
Where else can you learn

How cold is this night
Asks Daniel Fahrenheit

Poison hath begotten
But mushrooms shall not stop him

Four long years he waited
A son without a home
The apprenticeship short lived
Finally began to roam

Shopkeeping was too trite
For Daniel Fahrenheit

Each drop squeezed from sand
Glass he blew by hand

Hatters cool device
Trapped inside his pipe
Try to make it colder
Until it was just right

Mouth but do not bite
At Daniel Fahrenheit

Everyone knows Fahrenheit
But nobody knows Daniel
And even Anders
Doesn't get the credit he deserves
Celsius

Temperatures rise
kingdoms fall
forgotten truth
irrational

Who in the hell is this 
Daniel Fahrenheit

He has a song 
We all sing along
But some of us
just don't know why
